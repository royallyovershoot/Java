Welcome to Stock data Downloader !

With this software You can simply obtain full and recent data from yahoo finance. Included in the package is all Nasdaq
stocks, however if you would like to add other stock data other than Nasdaq you can simply add 
your ticker to the TickerListNasdaq array in Tickers.java

Once satisfied run the program via the main class Run.java. There is a 10 second delay every 
10 stock data download, however you can chose to reduce that or even remove the delay completely. 

The delay was added in the first place to avoid yahoo server error messages, however the errors
has been managed in this program. So it is just recommended to remove the delay in Run.java.


A sample of the data obtained from this program is in the folder _Merged.xls. Of course the folders will be 
downloaded as one file per stock . SO later when all the download is complete you can chose to 
merge them into one folder which is what was done with _Merged.xls

Enjoy!
